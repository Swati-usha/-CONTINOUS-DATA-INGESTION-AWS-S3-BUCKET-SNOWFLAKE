Continuous Data Ingestion from AWS S3 to Snowflake - README

Welcome to the Continuous Data Ingestion from AWS S3 to Snowflake project README!

Project Overview:
This project aims to establish a seamless and automated pipeline for continuously ingesting data from an AWS S3 bucket into Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing platform. By setting up this pipeline, organizations can ensure that their Snowflake databases are continuously updated with the latest data from their S3 buckets, enabling real-time analytics and decision-making.

Key Components:

AWS S3 Bucket: The source of data containing the files to be ingested into Snowflake. This could be structured data files (e.g., CSV, JSON) representing various aspects of business operations.

Snowflake Data Warehouse: The destination where the data from the S3 bucket will be ingested. Snowflake provides a scalable and flexible cloud data warehouse solution for storing and analyzing large volumes of data.

Snowflake External Stage: An external stage in Snowflake that points to the AWS S3 bucket. This allows Snowflake to access and load data directly from the S3 bucket without needing to copy the data into Snowflake storage.

AWS IAM Role: An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permissions to access the S3 bucket. This role is used by Snowflake to authenticate and access the S3 bucket for data ingestion.

Snowflake External S3 Integration: An external S3 integration in Snowflake that connects Snowflake to the AWS S3 bucket using the IAM role. This integration enables Snowflake to securely access the S3 bucket and load data into Snowflake.

Snowflake Pipe: A Snowflake pipe that defines the ingestion process from the S3 bucket to Snowflake. The pipe is configured to continuously monitor the S3 bucket for new data and automatically load it into Snowflake tables.
